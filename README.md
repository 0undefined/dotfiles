# Dotfiles

I dont like cluttering in `~` so I configured everything to respect xdg user
dirs.

## Software I use

* `zsh`, the z-shell
* `st` as a terminal emulator (therefore no terminal configs)
* `vim` for text editing with
  [jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim) colorscheme
* `dunst` for notifications
* `i3` or `dwm` depending on the machine I am using
* `zathura` for document viewing
